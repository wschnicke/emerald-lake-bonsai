# Spring Repotting Guide

Spring is the most critical time for repotting most bonsai species. In the Pacific Northwest, timing and technique are everything.

## When to Repot

The ideal time is when you see the first signs of bud swell but before leaves emerge. In the PNW, this typically means:

- **Early Spring** (February-March): Japanese maples, elms, deciduous trees
- **Late Spring** (March-April): Pines, junipers, most conifers
- **Species-specific timing**: Always research your specific species

## Essential Tools and Materials

### Tools Needed
- Root rake or chopstick
- Sharp scissors or shears
- Root cutters for thick roots
- Wire cutters
- Mesh screens for drainage holes
- Wire for securing the tree

### Soil Components
A well-draining mix is critical in our wet climate:

- **Akadama**: 40-50% - water retention and nutrients
- **Pumice**: 25-30% - drainage and aeration
- **Lava rock**: 20-25% - drainage and structure
- **Optional**: Small amount of composted bark for deciduous trees

## Step-by-Step Repotting Process

### 1. Prepare Your Workspace
- Gather all tools and materials
- Prepare your soil mix
- Have clean pots ready with mesh and wire

### 2. Remove the Tree
- Water the tree the day before to make root ball manageable
- Carefully remove from pot
- Gently loosen the root ball with a root rake

### 3. Root Work
- Remove old, exhausted soil
- Trim long roots, especially those circling the pot
- **Cut back 1/3 to 1/2 of the root mass** for established trees
- Preserve fine feeder roots
- Create a radial root structure

### 4. Pot Preparation
- Secure mesh over drainage holes
- Add anchoring wires if needed
- Create a small mound of fresh soil in the center

### 5. Position and Secure
- Position tree at proper angle and height
- Add soil, working it into root mass with chopstick
- Leave no air pockets
- Secure tree with wire if needed

### 6. Finishing
- Water thoroughly until water runs clear
- Place in protected location out of wind
- **No fertilizer for 4-6 weeks**

## Post-Repotting Care

### First Two Weeks
- Keep in shade or filtered light
- Protect from wind
- Water when soil surface begins to dry
- No fertilizing

### Weeks 3-6
- Gradually increase light exposure
- Monitor for new growth
- Continue regular watering
- Begin light fertilizing after 4-6 weeks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Repotting too early**: Wait for bud swell
2. **Using poorly draining soil**: Death sentence in PNW
3. **Removing too many roots**: Weakens the tree
4. **Fertilizing immediately**: Burns new roots
5. **Placing in full sun too soon**: Stresses recovering tree

## Species-Specific Notes

### Japanese Maples
- Repot every 2-3 years when young, 3-5 years when mature
- Very forgiving of root work
- Best done in late February to early March

### Pines
- Repot every 3-5 years
- Preserve mycorrhizal fungi - don't bare-root
- Keep some old soil around roots

### Junipers
- Very hardy, can handle aggressive root work
- Repot every 2-4 years
- Best in April when growth is strong
