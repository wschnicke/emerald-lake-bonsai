When I decided to start intensive bonsai instruction, I had a long-shot goal of working professionally in bonsai.
I even mentioned as much when contacting my teacher. This goal was inspired by reading a job opening at
Pacific Bonsai Museum, which I was far from qualified for, but decided I would fix that before the next role became available.
The vague plan in my head represented the development of a bonsai itself--I’ll get there when I get there,
and not for many years. I started studying, volunteering, and working on trees, expecting nothing more a slow path.

This one goal--to get *paid* to do bonsai and attain all the license that comes with it, pushed me to set more goals,
and then to refine these into mantras, the first of which:

> The goal is to work on great trees, not to own them

## The opportunity

This summer, I am working at the Pacific Bonsai Museum as the bonsai intern. This new program is financed by the Puget
Sound Bonsai Association, and as a member of both of these organizations, I could not be more grateful to be called on;
 I will make it worth the cost and risk.

At the time I was contacted about this position, I was in the middle of a search for a new day job[^1]. I was hoping to
find a role that would give me more time to focus on bonsai and perhaps begin part-time work in the field. The timing
couldn’t have been more fateful—I had already put my last day at my job on the calendar.

Around this time, Jonas Dupuich gave me clear advice: “whatever you want do, start now.” This is exactly what I am
doing–treating my bonsai career as a professional one.


## The offerings

Emerald Lake Garden will be a full-service bonsai garden. I plan to focus on collaboration and education, helping clients and students improve their collections, or learn together on mine. I will also explore bonsai display, in traditional, exhibition, and novel settings. Whether you need an extra pair of hands or a guide, a demo or workshop, I would love to help.

- Bonsai services for hire, onsite or in my workspace
  - Repotting
  - Styling and wiring
  - Ongoing maintenance
  - Whatever you have in mind
- Education, either 1-on-1 or in a workshop setting
- Corporate events: demos, workshops, display rental
- Landscape tree pruning


### a note on the site

The Emerald Lake Garden website, like all of the garden, is a work in progress. I started out on a WordPress site,
but found that painful to use compared to building a site myself.

[^1]: I started using this term as a joke after realizing I'd begun answering "What do you do?" with "bonsai" instead of my corporate job.
