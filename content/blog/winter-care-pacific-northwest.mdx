# Winter Care for Bonsai in the Pacific Northwest

Winter in the Pacific Northwest is unlike anywhere else. Our mild, wet winters present unique challenges and opportunities for bonsai care that differ significantly from traditional Japanese methods or the harsh freezes of the Eastern United States.

## Understanding Our Winter Climate

The PNW winter is characterized by:

- **Mild temperatures**: Rarely dropping below 25°F (-4°C)
- **High rainfall**: Often 4-6 inches per month from November through March
- **Low light levels**: Overcast skies and short days
- **Occasional freezes**: Brief cold snaps that require vigilance

## Winter Protection Strategies

### 1. Shelter from Excessive Rain

While rain is generally beneficial, too much water can lead to root rot, especially in pots with poor drainage.

**Solutions:**
- Move trees under eaves during heavy rain periods
- Ensure excellent drainage in all pots
- Tilt pots slightly to prevent water pooling
- Use well-draining soil mixes with plenty of akadama and pumice

### 2. Monitor for Root Rot

The combination of cool temperatures and wet soil creates ideal conditions for root rot.

**Signs to watch for:**
- Yellowing foliage
- Soft, mushy roots
- Foul smell from the soil
- Needle drop on conifers (beyond normal seasonal shedding)

**Prevention:**
- Reduce watering frequency (let soil dry slightly between waterings)
- Check drainage holes regularly
- Avoid fertilizing during dormancy

### 3. Protect During Rare Freezes

When temperatures drop below 28°F (-2°C), take action:

- Move tender species (Japanese maples, trident maples, azaleas) into an unheated garage or shed
- Mulch around pots with bark or straw
- Group trees together for mutual protection
- Cover with frost cloth for brief cold snaps

### 4. Manage Low Light

Winter's dim conditions can stress evergreen species.

**Best practices:**
- Position trees to maximize available light
- Rotate trees weekly for even exposure
- Avoid heavy pruning that removes photosynthetic material
- Keep foliage clean of moss and debris

## Species-Specific Notes

### Hardy Conifers (Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar, Shore Pine)
These native species are perfectly adapted to our winters and need minimal protection. Keep them outdoors and enjoy their resilience.

### Japanese Maples
Our mild winters mean Japanese maples often don't fully harden off. Protect from freezes below 25°F and watch for premature bud break during warm spells in late winter.

### Deciduous Natives (Vine Maple, Big Leaf Maple)
These are completely hardy. Focus on ensuring good drainage and protecting dormant buds from excessive moisture.

### Tropical and Subtropical Species
Move indoors before first frost. Ficus, jade, and bougainvillea need indoor protection all winter with supplemental lighting.

## Winter Maintenance Tasks

This is an excellent time for:

- **Wire work**: Without foliage, branch structure is clearly visible
- **Major structural pruning**: Trees heal well when dormant
- **Repotting preparation**: Clean pots, prepare soil mixes, order supplies
- **Tool maintenance**: Sharpen, clean, and oil your tools
- **Study**: Read, take online courses, plan your spring work

## The Gift of Winter

While it may seem like a dormant period, winter is when trees build strength for spring's explosive growth. By understanding and working with our unique PNW climate, we can ensure our trees emerge healthy, vigorous, and ready for the growing season.

Remember: less is more in winter. The most common mistake is overwatering and overfertilizing. Let your trees rest, and they'll reward you come spring.

Stay dry out there!
